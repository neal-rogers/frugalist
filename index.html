            <p>
            Some might call me a reserved but charismatic individual with a penchant for sarcasm and dark humor. Others might choose more colorful and unflattering expletives to describe my character. I'd like to think the real me is somewhere in the middle.
            <br><br>
            For about a decade I worked in the information technology field, both in the public and private sectors, including a brief attempt at running my own computer repair operation. But in time I realized I'd denied myself a potentially far more satisfying career in art and design.
            <br><br>
            As I start a new journey and reboot <a href="https://www.nealvrogers.com/resume" class="blue">my career</a>, I hope the City That Never Sleeps will continue to inspire me, to urge me to create, and guilt me into pursuing what I truly love. 
            <br><br>
            TLDR; I’m an artist from The Lou trying to make it in the Big Apple.
